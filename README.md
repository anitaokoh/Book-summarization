#   Book Summarization

For my final project, I attempted to summarize a book using the extractive summarization method with the help of a python library called **Sumy**. I also used an APP to detect the dominant emotions each chapter.


I combined all this and wrapped them in a flask framework, building a web app with the help of HTML and CSS.

**Here is a demo of the web app**

_Further improvements will be done on the project like adding more books to the directory and making it more dynamic_
